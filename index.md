#Data Description:
I plan to use qualitative data sets throughout my research and have already acquired some of my data through this method. In my time as an intern in the Michigan State Senate I was able to speak to policymakers and other influencers of public policy. This allowed me to shape questions and discussions which could be used tangibly in my research.
#Roles & Responsilbilies:
The roles that my advisor will hold in my research process include data collection/organization/ analysis as well as quality control. It is likely that other responsibilities will be needed but this will become clear as my research project progresses.My research is not extremely data-heavy within the qualitative field, however, I will require future assistance in strengthening this bit of my research. I am still sorting out the specific question I want to ask for my project as I will likely further connect DFRT to demographics (age, race, etc.) and possible connections to inequity or lack of access to certain societal expectations or concerns. 
#Storage and Security:
Videos, recordings, informational data sets, images, spreadsheets, data organizing platforms (ICPSR), and all other relevant datasets will likely take a few GBs. Videos will be the largest size if I plan to incorporate sound bits or other similar information. The videos will be multiple GBs. My project is only a few MBs right now, but I would predict everything to end up being anywhere from 5 ~ 15 GBs. Much of this data will be held in spreadsheets, word/documents, and recordings (voice, physically). The data will be on my computer, phone, USB, etc. Whichever method is most efficient and ethical for the project I am currently undertaking. This will continue to be worked out as I continue to have conversations with my advisor, committee members, and relevant DFRT stakeholders. Confidential data will be held in secure databases (not sure which specifically yet) and likely under the responsibility of myself, advisors, and stakeholders. 
#Access & Data Sharing:
OSU sensitive and confidential data is broken down into three categories of unrestricted, sensitive, and confidential data. These categories are based on the level of security the information needs, and “understanding the relative sensitivity of that information helps you understand which of the categories the data fit in” (OSU, 2022). 
#Archiving & Preservation:
My backup data strategy will consist of multiple databases protected by those with close knowledge of my research. My research will contain at least three protected copies to ensure information is not lost or misused. Depending on my data collection strategies and the depth of research attained, I will determine the implementation process. Automatic copies may be an easier method, but data with complex coding or other variables may require a manual process. I do not expect my data to become too complex so I will likely use spreadsheets and ICPSR but am still working out this process with my advisor and am not completely sure which will best fit my study. The shared network I have is also backed up in the drive and often saves into a word format. This information is very important to my study and will be monitored/stored on a frequent basis.
