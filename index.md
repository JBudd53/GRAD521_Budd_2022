I plan to use qualitative data sets throughout my research and have already acquired some of my data through this method. In my time as an intern in the Michigan State Senate I was able to speak to policymakers and other influencers of public policy. This allowed me to shape questions and discussions which could be used tangibly in my research. Many of my conversations were with the medical professionals in Michigan who have advocated the most for the implementation of DFRT. DFRT is continuing to be discussed in the legislature, as the Senator I worked for introduced the bill last spring, but is hoping for a floor vote in the coming months. I hope to acquire more data from human subjects through interviews, screensings, questionnaires, and other methods of research as I continue in my qualitative studies.
