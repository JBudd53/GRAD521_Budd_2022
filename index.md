I plan to use qualitative data sets throughout my research and have already acquired some of my data through this method. In my time as an intern in the Michigan State Senate I was able to speak to policymakers and other influencers of public policy. This allowed me to shape questions and discussions which could be used tangibly in my research. Many of my conversations were with the medical professionals in Michigan who have advocated the most for the implementation of DFRT. DFRT is continuing to be discussed in the legislature, as the Senator I worked for introduced the bill last spring, but is hoping for a floor vote in the coming months. I hope to acquire more data from human subjects through interviews, screensings, questionnaires, and other methods of research as I continue in my qualitative studies.
The roles that my advisor will hold in my research process include data collection/organization/ analysis as well as quality control. It is likely that other responsibilities will be needed but this will become clear as my research project progresses. I had difficulties reaching out to my advisor and he never emailed me back so it is difficult to answer this question as specifically as possible. I will require assistance in organizing interview data, statistics relating to DFRT, and other demographic information that I will tie in my seriously with my research. My research is not extremely data-heavy within the qualitative field, however, I will require future assistance in strengthening this bit of my research. I am still sorting out the specific question I want to ask for my project as I will likely further connect DFRT to demographics (age, race, etc.) and possible connections to inequity or lack of access to certain societal expectations or concerns. I realize this is vague but once again, I am waiting for my advisor's input. My advisor will have most of the responsibility in this regard, but it is also possible that the medical organizations and the Michigan State legislature may possess future responsibilities I am still unaware of or considering. If somebody with responsibilities left the project (contingency plan - research digital repository?), I would seek to find a way for them to transfer this access to me or reach out to a different faculty member or an advisor who could take this responsibility and contribute to my research.
